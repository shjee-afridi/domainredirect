- This project is a Next.js clone of hentaidiscord.com, but branded as "Anime Discord".
- All titles, meta tags, and branding should use "Anime Discord".
- The site must include a `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` tag and a `robots.txt` that disallows all crawling.
- The backend (MongoDB, Discord bot) is shared with hentaidiscord.com.
- Do not include any SEO or indexing features for animediscord.com.
- All links, UI, and text should reflect the "Anime Discord" branding.
